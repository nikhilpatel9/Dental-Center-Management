Technical Decisions
State Management

Chose Context API + useReducer over Redux for simpler global state needs
Implemented localStorage persistence for critical data

UI Framework

Used Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with utility classes
Lucide React for consistent, customizable icons

Routing

Implemented protected routes with role-based access control
Dynamic navigation based on user role

Data Structure

Sample data structure with patients and appointments relationships
Mock data initialization with localStorage fallback

Known Issues
Data Persistence

Currently using localStorage which clears when browser cache is cleared
No true backend/database integration

Form Validation

Basic validation implemented but could be more comprehensive
No client-side validation for some forms

Responsiveness

Some pages may need additional responsive design tweaks

Accessibility

Basic accessibility implemented but could be improved with ARIA labels

Future Improvements
Backend Integration

Connect to a real API/database
Implement proper authentication with JWT

Enhanced Features

Treatment plans and prescriptions
Billing and payment integration
Patient messaging system

Testing

Add unit and integration tests
Implement end-to-end testing

Performance

Optimize large data sets with pagination
Implement lazy loading for components
